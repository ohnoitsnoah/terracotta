This is an updated version of the microblogging app I began working on in the previous directory. So far I have a simple working account system, and posting system. I'm trying to get likes up next, then profile pages. More updates to come.

Today I'm going to try to figure out how to get likes working properly. Right now they are able to get incremented infinitely, so I'm gonna figure out a way where you can only like or unlike, and still contribute to the number of likes. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my database.
